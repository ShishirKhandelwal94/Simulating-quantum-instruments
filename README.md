Note: all files need CVX and QETLAB.
1. Instrument_sim.m calculates critical visibilities for a given instrument with white/dephasing/arbitrary noises. (functions appended genpart.mlx and dephasing_noise.mlx)
2. hemis_discrimination.m calculates optimal fidelity with a given success probability for the hemisphere discrimination problem.
3. sequential_chsh.m performs a seesaw search in the trade-off between two sequential CHSH parameter and outputs a quantum model for a double violation.
